My orchestration from the piano score of this polka by Philipp Fahrbach I.

I waste a fair bit of money on Fahrbach. When I order music online I usually don’t see the music till it arrives. Fahrbach is very fond of special effects which I can sometimes do but often can’t. There is a cockeral and gunshots in the ones I’ve done and some singing that I have omitted. I have a waltz in the pile that contains several different birdcalls and a bagpipe cadenza that will be complete guesswork if I ever work up courage to give it a go. 

This polka should have the orchestra singing or shouting ”Lulu” almost everywhere  there is a two note motif and there are lots of them. I can’t easily do vocal sounds on the computer, but do feel free. It’s a nice polka even without the lulu’s.
