Bach Orchestral Suite no. 3 BWV 1068, outstandingly performed by Musica Antiqua Köln directed by Reinhard Goebel, conductor and violinist. This is one of the very few versions where the fugue in the overture is performed as a solo violin concerto, the way it was probably conceived, which should be apparent to anyone just looking at the score.

1. Ouverture - 00:00
2. Air - 10:25
3. Gavotte 1 & 2 - 15:01
4. Bourée - 18:45
5. Gigue - 20:17
